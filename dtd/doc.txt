I decided to create a very human-readable dtd file, which can also be easy to parse it.
The root of the document is the flightInfo element, which is composed by a list of flight elements and a set of aircrafts.
Every flight element has some attributes and all of them are required. Moreover flightID is an ID,
 which is unique in the whole XML document and it's used to easily access flight data.
 Then, I decided that every flight is composed by different flightInstances, each of them can be
 uniquely identified by flightID and departureDate attributes.
To make the whole document more human-readable and to reduce the number of redundancies, 
I went for a nested design. In fact, my flightInstance element is composed by a list of passengers,  
who have booked this flightInstance.
To enforce the link between the passenger element and the flightInstance, I set flightID and 
departureDate as attributes of the passenger element.
